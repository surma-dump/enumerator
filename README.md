Enumerator
==========

A simple file renaming tool


Motivation
----------
Whenever I backup a TV series to disk, I want to the files (i.e. the episodes)
to be named consistently. It's fairly tedious to do that manually, so I wrote
this. This is also my first C# project so don't expect beautiful or idiomatic
code.


How to Build
------------
- Get yourself [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com) (or install Gtk# for MS Visual Studio)
- Open `enumerator.sln`
- Press the `Build` button
